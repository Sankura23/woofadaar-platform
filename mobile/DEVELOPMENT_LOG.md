## Session Log

### 2025-09-28

#### üêï Homepage Welcome Card Enhancement ‚úÖ
**Request**: Replace dog icon in welcome card with custom cute dog illustration
**Implementation**:
- Added `cute-dog-illustration.png` to `/assets/` (170x170px, transparent PNG)
- Replaced `MaterialCommunityIcons` dog icon with `Image` component
- **File**: `/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx` (lines 190-194)
- **Positioning**: Absolute positioning (`bottom: -50, right: -35`) for natural overflow
- **Size**: 170x170px with full opacity for crisp appearance

**Key Challenge**:
- Initial PNG format caused Metro bundler errors
- Converted to JPG temporarily but lost transparency (white background)
- **Solution**: Optimized original PNG with `sips -Z 300` to reduce file size
- Final result: Large, transparent dog image seamlessly integrated

#### üè• Health Section Complete Redesign ‚úÖ
**Problem**: User feedback: "i hate the ui on health" - too many colors, overwhelming design
**Solution**: Complete redesign with Apple-inspired, minimalist approach

**Major Changes**:
1. **Removed Complex Elements**:
   - Hero header with gradient background
   - Multiple colored overview cards
   - Complex health analytics/trends
   - Overwhelming insights panel

2. **New Clean Design**:
   - Simple header matching dashboard style
   - Clean dog selector card
   - **Health Overview**: 4 compact stat cards (Mood, Energy, Exercise, Total Logs)
   - **Quick Actions**: Apple-style rounded cards with centered icons
   - **Recent Logs**: Simplified display with essential info

3. **Color Simplification**:
   - **From**: Multiple colors (orange, purple, yellow, various teal shades)
   - **To**: Primarily mint teal (`Colors.primary.mintTeal`) with white backgrounds

**File**: `/src/screens/health/HealthScreen.tsx` (completely rewritten - 391 lines)

**User Feedback**:
- Initial Apple Watch-style buttons: "quick actions look good"
- Requested revert to "more rounded" version: ‚úÖ Implemented centered, rounded design

#### üìä Health Stats Implementation ‚úÖ
**Added**: Automatic health metrics calculation from user logs
- **Average Mood**: Last 7 days calculation
- **Average Energy**: Last 7 days calculation
- **Total Exercise**: Weekly minutes sum
- **Total Logs**: All-time count
- **Display**: 4 clean stat cards with mint teal values

### 2025-09-27

#### ‚úÖ Fixed: Community Screen Icon Colors
**Problem**: Quick action icons (Ask, Top, Experts, Saved) appeared gray instead of white
**Solution**: Changed from outline icons to solid versions
- `add-circle-outline` ‚Üí `add-circle`
- `trending-up` ‚Üí `trophy`
- `bookmark-outline` ‚Üí `bookmark`
- Icons now render as pure white (#FFFFFF)

#### üé¨ Video Splash Screen Implementation Attempts

**Initial Request**: Add animated video splash screen using "woofadaar logo animation (Mobile Video).mp4"

**Attempt #1 - expo-av**
- **Approach**: Used Video component from expo-av
- **Error**: `Cannot find native module 'ExponentAV'`
- **Reason**: expo-av requires native modules not available in Expo Go

**Attempt #2 - WebView Alternative**
- **Approach**: Tried WebView as workaround
- **Result**: Still unstable, user requested revert
- **User Quote**: "just don't break whats already working. please."

**Final Decision**: User requested revert to static splash screen
- **User Quote**: "ok you know what, just revert to the version before i told you to add video. that is better for now"

#### üé® Lottie Animation Implementation (Current Solution) ‚úÖ

**Recommended by Grok AI**: Use Lottie animations instead of MP4 video
- **Benefits**:
  - Compatible with Expo Go (no native module issues)
  - Better performance (vector-based)
  - Smaller file sizes
  - More control over playback

**Implementation Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Installed `lottie-react-native` package
2. ‚úÖ Created `/assets/animations/` directory
3. ‚úÖ Updated SplashScreen.tsx with LottieView support
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Initial error: `Unable to resolve module` - require() at build time
5. ‚úÖ Fixed by temporarily disabling Lottie until file is added
6. ‚úÖ User added splash.json file (184KB)
7. ‚úÖ Implemented full Lottie animation with fade-out transition

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Using enhanced animated splash screen

**Resolution**:
- Lottie requires native modules that need app rebuild in Xcode
- Since everything else works without rebuilding, reverted to React Native Animated API
- Enhanced the animation with rotation and smooth transitions
- Works immediately without any native dependencies
- User correctly pointed out: "until this point we had no issues with development... doesn't make any sense"

- ‚úÖ Added pre-filled login credentials for dev (e@c.com / Password)
- ‚úÖ Connected to real backend API (no mock data)

### UI/UX Improvements
- ‚úÖ Bottom tab navigation order: Home, Community, Health, My Dogs, Profile
- ‚úÖ Community screen with horizontal quick actions

## Known Issues & TODOs

### Pending
- None at the moment

### Resolved Today
- ‚úÖ Community screen icon colors (now pure white)
- ‚úÖ Splash screen crash (reverted to stable version)
- ‚úÖ Lottie animation attempt (reverted to animated splash due to native module requirements)
- ‚úÖ Add Dog form dropdowns not working on iOS - replaced with custom modal pickers
- ‚úÖ Dog creation and My Dogs refresh - added useFocusEffect for auto-refresh
- ‚úÖ Profile user photo display - added fallback with user initials

---

## Important Notes

### User Requirements
- **NO mock data** - database only
- **NO demo logins** - real authentication only
- **Preserve UI designs** - user loves current Community design
- **Listen carefully** - "make sure you don't go way back to old design"

### Technical Considerations
- Expo Go limitations with native modules
- Use Lottie instead of video for animations
- Always provide fallback for missing assets
- Test thoroughly before implementing video/animation features

---

## Next Steps
1. Wait for user to provide Lottie JSON file
2. Implement proper Lottie detection and playback
3. Continue with other app features as requested
